# MyFirstApplication

This is my first ever Android app written in Kotlin. I drew my inspiration from https://github.com/xbadut/Dicoding-Submission-Android-Pemula. Thank you, Rizal Fahrudin, if you read this.

I submitted this Application as final task of Dicoding Indonesia's course on Android "Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Android untuk Pemula." Thus, thank you, Dicoding Indonesia, for paving my path to become Android developer.

In this simple application, I only use RecyclerView and basic Intent. I want to develop my skill in Kotlin and Android so I can build some awesome applications of my own.
